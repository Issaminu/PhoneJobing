# About

As part of creating a solution that solves the multitude of problems faced by 
corporate sales departments, we designed and created a web application that centralizes the entire workflow of sales teams under a single roof.

An application that integrates all the responsibilities of the sales team managers, as 
well as their teleoperators, would be extremely beneficial to all companies, large or 
small. It would make workflows easier and faster, increase productivity and maximize 
value.

Our solution, hosted on the web at phone-jobing.issaminu.com allows sales team managers to 
manage their teleoperators, track their progress, performance and efficiency, as well 
as manage the inventory of all company products, and create call scripts to guide 
teleoperators through the sales process. And as for the teleoperators, it gives them 
access to an easy-to-use interface to help them make calls and record their results.
